## Inspiration

School is hard. Prioritizing sleep is hard. Especially in the midst of a pandemic, the concept of time has felt nonexistent. While stuck at home, many of us have adopted bad sleeping habits, staying up to extremely late hours on our devices. Sleep is a vital, often neglected, component of every person's well-being. Drowsy is an app that will help you keep a steady sleep schedule for better health.

## What it does

By opening up the app every night and placing it on "sleep mode." Drowsy will record the number of hours you've slept each night and warn you if you exit without a good night's sleep of at least 7 hours. The goal of Drowsy was to motivate people into healthy sleeping habits.

## How we built it

This project was built using React Native, SQLite, and Expo

## Challenges we ran into

This is the first hackathon we've both participated in, and the first time both of us had used React Native and developed a mobile application. So, there was definitely a steep learning curve in the technologies and trying to organize a project in a small time period. Ironically, while building an app to promote and maintain healthy sleeping habits, both of us stayed up past 5 AM working on the app.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We're proud that we were able to have a working project after challenging ourselves with technologies that were completely new to us.

## What we learned

We've learned a lot about React and JavaScript, and working together as a team.

## What's next for Drowsy

There is definitely a lot more to come for Drowsy that will hopefully be implemented in the near future!
